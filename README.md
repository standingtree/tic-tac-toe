# Tic-Tac-Toe in React
A simple tic-tac-toe game in React. The game passes React component state between parent and child elements in the DOM, and displays a winner when 3 X's or O's are marked in a row by the same player.

### How to run: 
<ol>
  <li>Default player is Player X. Click a square to claim for Player X. Game play then turns to Player O. 
</ol>

### Roadmap for future improvements: 
<ol>
  <li>Highlight winning set of 3 squares.</li>
  <li>Have a score tally if users want to play multiple games.</li>
  <li>Allow users to change player names via an input box.</li>
</ol>
